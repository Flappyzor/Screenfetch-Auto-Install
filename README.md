Screenfetch-Auto-Install
========================

I don't know why I made this, don't look at it.

--- I would recommend running the script from your home directory, since it is basically the only directory I've seen this work in ---

Anyway if you do decide to look at it, heres what you want to do.

wget The script from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flappyzor/Screenfetch-Auto-Install/master/bong.sh

Then chmod +x bong.sh so it can actually do shit

Then ./bong.sh to run the shit, and it should do shit and hopefully install screenfetch
