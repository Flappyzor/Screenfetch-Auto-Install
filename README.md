Screenfetch-Auto-Install
========================

Well, if you decide to look at this then do this shit in order:

**sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flappyzor/Screenfetch-Auto-Install/master/bong.sh**

**sudo bash bong.sh**


And there you have it, you have now commited to the buddymen.

If something doesn't work or something breaks on what ever twisted as shit distro you're using then email me: flappy@goat.si

Or actually you could just post an issue, why not take a gander at both?
