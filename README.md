Screenfetch-Auto-Install
========================

I don't know why I made this, don't look at it.

--- I would recommend running the script from your home directory, since it is basically the only directory I've seen this work in ---

Anyway so if you decide to look at this, here is the shit you need to do in order:

sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flappyzor/Screenfetch-Auto-Install/master/bong.sh 

sudo bash ./bong.sh

And then hey look you used it wow

o wwo wwo wo wwo wwo wwowow
